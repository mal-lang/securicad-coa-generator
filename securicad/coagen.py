        TODO: in the future needs to be adapted to get costs etc. as arguments from the Orchestrator (and not local files).
        IMPORTANT: in what is described below, "defense_step" is of the form "class.eid.object_name.step_name"
        see comments in AttackGraph._get_params_from_json to see how this format is constructed from attack paths
        fetched from securiCAD.

        === Expected format of .json files containing cost specifications (files under 'costs_path' and 'times_path'):

        {
            "1": {
                "defense_step1": float_value,
                "defense_step2": {
                    "default": float_value,
                    "same_type_dependency": {
                        "int": float_value,
                        ...
                        "int": float_value,
                    },
                    "different_type_dependency": {
                        "defense_step": "+float",
                        "defense_step": "-float",
                        "defense_step": "*float"
                    }
                }
            }
            "2": ...
        }

        Interpretation:

        - The first cost of implementation of "defense_step1" is constant, doesn't depend on implementation of other steps,
        and is equal to float_value1.
        - By default, the first cost of implementation of "defense_step2" is equal to float_value2. However, the cost depends
        on implementation of other steps.
        If "defense_step2" is implemented along exactly one other step of the same type (e.g., if "defense_step2" = "host1.patch",
        then by 'the same type' we mean 'patch' defense steps applied to instances of 'host' asset), then its cost is 12.
        If "defense_step2" is implemented along two or more other steps of the same type (say, "host2.patch" and "host3.patch
        with "defense_step2" = "host1.patch"), then its cost is 10.
        Once steps of the same type are analyzed, the base cost of "defense_step2" is established. It is later modified depending
        on defense steps of other types: if "defense_step3" is to be implemented along "defense_step2", then the cost of "defense_step2"
        is increased by 10, etc.

        Note: haven't thought it through, the final cost will depend on the order in which the operations coming from dependencies
        on steps of other types are performed. Well, this is a prototype. Should be taken care of in the final version.

        Note: monetary and time-like cost specifications should be stored in separate files.
